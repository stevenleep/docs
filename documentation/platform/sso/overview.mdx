<Info>
  Infisical offers Google SSO and GitHub SSO for free across both Infisical Cloud and Infisical Self-hosted.
  
  Infisical also offers SAML SSO authentication but as paid features that can be unlocked on Infisical Cloud's **Pro** tier
  or via enterprise license on self-hosted instances of Infisical. On this front, we support industry-leading providers including 
  Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud; with any questions, please reach out to team@infisical.com.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

To note, Infisical's SSO implementation decouples the **authentication** and **decryption** steps – which implies that no
Identity Provider can have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets (this also implies that Infisical requires entering the user's Master Password on top of authenticating with SSO).

## Identity providers

Infisical supports these and many other identity providers:

- [Google SSO](/documentation/platform/sso/google)
