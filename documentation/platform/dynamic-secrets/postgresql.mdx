  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the inputs for dynamic secret parameters">
	<ParamField path="Secret Name" type="string" required>
		Name by which you want the secret to be referenced
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Default TTL" type="string" required>
		Default time-to-live for a generated secret (it is possible to modify this value when a secret is generate)
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Max TTL" type="string" required>
		Maximum time-to-live for a generated secret
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Service" type="string" required>
		Choose the service you want to generate dynamic secrets for
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Host" type="string" required>
		Database host
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Port" type="number" required>
		Database port
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="User" type="string" required>
		Username that will be used to create dynamic secrets
	</ParamField>
