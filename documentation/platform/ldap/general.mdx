<Info>
    LDAP is a paid feature.
   If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
   then you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)

<Steps>
   <Step title="Prepare the LDAP configuration in Infisical">
        In Infisical, head to your Organization Settings > Authentication > LDAP Configuration and select **Set up LDAP**.

        Here's some guidance for each field:

        - URL: The LDAP server to connect to such as `ldap://ldap.your-org.com`, `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636` (for connection over SSL/TLS), etc.
        - Bind DN: The distinguished name of object to bind when performing the user search such as `cn=infisical,ou=Users,dc=acme,dc=com`.
        - Bind Pass: The password to use along with `Bind DN` when performing the user search.
        - Search Base / User DN: Base DN under which to perform user search such as `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
        - CA Certificate: The CA certificate to use when verifying the LDAP server certificate.
