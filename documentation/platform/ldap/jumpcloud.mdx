<Info>
    LDAP is a paid feature.
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Prepare LDAP in JumpCloud">
        In JumpCloud, head to USER MANAGEMENT > Users and create a new user via the **Manual user entry** option. This user
        will be used as a privileged service account to facilitate Infisical's ability to bind/search the LDAP directory.

        When creating the user, input their **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Username** (required), **Company Email** (required), and **Description**.
        Also, create a password for the user.

        Next, under User Security Settings and Permissions > Permission Settings, check the box next to **Enable as LDAP Bind DN**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Prepare the LDAP configuration in Infisical">
            In Infisical, head to your Organization Settings > Authentication > LDAP Configuration and select **Set up LDAP**.

            Next, input your JumpCloud LDAP server settings.

            Here's some guidance for each field:

            - URL: The LDAP server to connect to (`ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636`).
            - Bind DN: The distinguished name of object to bind when performing the user search (`uid=<ldap-user-username>,ou=Users,o=<your-org-id>,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`).
            - Bind Pass: The password to use along with `Bind DN` when performing the user search.
            - Search Base / User DN: Base DN under which to perform user search (`ou=Users,o=<your-org-id>,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`).
            - CA Certificate: The CA certificate to use when verifying the LDAP server certificate (instructions to obtain the certificate for JumpCloud [here](https://jumpcloud.com/support/connect-to-ldap-with-tls-ssl)).

            <Tip>
                When filling out the **Bind DN** and **Bind Pass** fields, refer to the username and password of the user created in Step 1.

                Also, for the **Bind DN** and **Search Base / User DN** fields, you'll want to use the organization ID that appears 
                in your LDAP instance **ORG DN**.
            </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable LDAP in Infisical">
            Enabling LDAP allows members in your organization to log into Infisical via LDAP.
