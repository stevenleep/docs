While most features in Infisical are free to use, others are paid and require purchasing an enterprise license to use them.

This guide walks through how you can use these paid features on a self hosted instance of Infisical.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Purchase a license">
        Start by either signing up for a free demo [here](https://infisical.com/schedule-demo) or contacting sales@infisical.com to purchase a license.

        Once purchased, you will be issued a license key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate the license">
        Depending on whether or not the environment where Infisical is deployed has internet access, you may be issued a regular license or an offline license.
        
        - If using a regular license, you should set the value of the environment variable `LICENSE_KEY` in Infisical to the issued license key.
        - If using an offline license, you should set the value of the environment variable `LICENSE_KEY_OFFLINE` in Infisical to the issued license key.

        <Note>
            How you set the environment variable will depend on the deployment method you used. Please refer to the documentation of your deployment method for specific instructions.
        </Note>

        Once your instance starts up, the license key will be validated and youâ€™ll be able to use the paid features. 
        However, when the license expires, Infisical will continue to run, but EE features will be disabled until the license is renewed or a new one is purchased.
